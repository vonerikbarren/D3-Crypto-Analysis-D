### Section 1 - Overview 
- This is a website that focuses on a using D3 to demonstrate crypto-currencies over a period of time. 
  Difference from A,B, and C are that the user can see a timeline of the whole time period for selected 
  currency but still have the full view of the time period fo that currency. This is important because if the user is
  looking for something specific, the user has a map to view the whole data set instead of guessing when and where 
  the data they are looking for has occcured.
